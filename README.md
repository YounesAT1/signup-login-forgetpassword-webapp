# signup-login-forgetpassword-webapp

This project is a static SignUp, LogIn, and ForgetPassword web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It provides a user-friendly and secure interface for user registration, login, and password recovery.

### Features
* SignUp: Users can create a new account by providing a username, email address, and password. The application validates the input fields     to ensure they are filled correctly.
* LogIn: Registered users can securely access their accounts by entering their username and password. The application verifies the input to   grant access or display appropriate error messages.
* ForgetPassword: If a user forgets their password, they can request a password reset email. By providing their registered email address,     the application sends an email containing instructions for resetting the password. A confirmation message is displayed upon successful     email submission.
